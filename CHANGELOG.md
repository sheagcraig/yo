## [1.0.3] - 2015-08-22 - Prince's Hair in Purple Rain

### Added
- Ability to execute bash scripts using the `-B/--bash-action` argument.

- Defaults to using the default notification sound now.
- If you set a sound to None, i.e. `-z None` there will be no sound.

## [1.0.1] - 2015-04-27 - David Bowie's Hair in the Movie Labyrinth
### Added
- License added to all source.
- Add shell script to execute yo (and avoid running if no logged in GUI user).
	- Installed to /usr/local/bin/yo if you use the installer package.

### Changed
